# Capstone Project

This is the Capstone Project of the HTML &amp; CSS module of the main curriculum of Microverse, and it aims to create an online game shop, inspired on the desing created by [Mohammed Awad](https://www.behance.net/gallery/24796463/ZATTIX).
In this project there are 2 pages: the first one is the main page, it displays some of the recommended games for different categories as well as the hot games of the week; the second page is the result search page (reacheable when clicking in the search button), and it displays the main results for the FPS genre.
